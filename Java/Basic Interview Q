 Q : Difference between primitive and non primitive data type.
Ans: These are the most basic data types predefined by the Java language.
Storage: They store actual values directly in memory.
Memory Efficiency: Generally more memory-efficient as they store raw data.
Null Values: Cannot be assigned null; they always hold a value.
Examples: int, byte, short, long, float, double, boolean, char.

Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types:
These are user-defined or built-in types that refer to objects.
Storage: They store references (memory addresses) to objects, not the objects themselves.
Memory Efficiency: Can be less memory-efficient than primitives due to object overhead and reference storage.
Null Values: Can be assigned null, indicating the absence of an object reference.
Methods: Have associated methods that can be invoked to perform operations on the object.
Examples: String, Arrays, Classes (e.g., Object, Scanner), Interfaces.
