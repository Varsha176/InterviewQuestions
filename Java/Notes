1. Bitwise XOR -- gives 1 for diff bits and 0 for same bits.
2. << Shift left -- generally doubles the number: ex : (8<<1) == 16
3. >> Shift right -- halfs the number : ex : (8 >> 1) == 4

Rule of Thumb
*********************
1. 1 file class can have multiple classes,but only 1 public class is accepted.

Static
*******************************
1.The static keyword is a non-access modifier used for:Variables (class-level, shared across instances),Methods (called without object creation).
2.Static variables and methods use memoStatic
3.Static members have one copy shared across the class.Non-static members have a separate copy for each instance of the class.
4.Static members are accessed via the class name.Non-static members are accessed via an object reference.
5.Static members cannot be overridden.Non-static members can be overridden in subclasses.
6.Static members cannot use this or super keyword.Non-static members can use this and super keyword.
7.All static variables are stored in PermGen space of the heap memory.

q-Can a constructor be static in Java? Why or why not?
ans--No, a constructor cannot be static. Constructors are used to initialize objects (instances) of a class, while the static keyword applies to class-level members.
A static constructor would contradict the purpose of object instantiation.
